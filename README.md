# Discord Bot

This is a basic Discord bot built using `discord.py`. The bot can respond to simple commands like greetings, echoing messages, and basic arithmetic.

Features
- `!hello` - Responds with a friendly greeting.
- `!echo [message]` - Repeats the provided message.
- `!add [a] [b]` - Adds two numbers and returns the result.


- Python 3.8+
- `discord.py` library

Usage
Invite the bot to your server and use the following commands:

- `!hello` - Sends a greeting message.
- `!echo [message]` - Repeats the provided message.
- `!add [a] [b]` - Returns the sum of two numbers.

Troubleshooting
- Ensure the bot has permission to read and send messages.
- Verify your bot token is correct.
- Ensure `discord.py` is installed correctly.

Notes
I am a beginner in Discord bot development. Some commands might have errors or unexpected behavior. Feedback and contributions are welcome!
